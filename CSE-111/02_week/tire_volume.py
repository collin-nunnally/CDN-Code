1. Gets the current date from the computerâ€™s operating system.
2. Opens a text file named volumes.txt for appending.
3. Appends to the end of the volumes.txt file one line of text that contains the following five values:
    a. current date
    b. width of the tire
    c. aspect ratio of the tire
    d. diameter of the wheel
    e. volume of the tire

Ex Output:
> python tire_volume.py
Enter the width of the tire in mm (ex 205): 185
Enter the aspect ratio of the tire (ex 60): 50
Enter the diameter of the wheel in inches (ex 15): 14

The approximate volume is 24.09 liters
