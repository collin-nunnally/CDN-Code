        Hello! My name is Collin Nunnally, I am a current student at BYU-I seeking a degree in Cybersecurity. Cybersecurity, and most tech, has been a passion of mine since I was a kid. I loved using my computer as a kid playing video games, but that has now transitioned to coding and learning about new topics. Some other hobbies that I have outside of the web are hiking, kayaking, backpacking, soccer, and playing guitar. 
        <br><br>I will also include pages that reference things like my resume with work experience and some projects that I have done and posted on my GitHub. My contact information will be in the footer of the page! :)
