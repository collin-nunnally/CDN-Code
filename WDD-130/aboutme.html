    <h2>Collin Nunnally</h2>
    <h2>No nickname :)</h2>
    <p>A little about me is that I grew up in Arizona, but moved to Ohio my senior year. It was a good transition for me, but I consider Arizona my home. I have a larger family with me being the 2nd youngest of 9 siblings. And 5 of my siblings are step siblings, but I still consider them family.</p><p>I grew up playing soccer and played all throughout high school for club and my school's team.</p>
    <p> am currently working as a server to help pay through college and I enjoy it a lot. I am studying to have a career in CyberSecurity, which is something I am passionate about. I enjoy getting into things that I am not suppose to be in, so I feel like this is a perfect career for me! :)</p>
    <p>Looking forward to getting to know you.</p>
