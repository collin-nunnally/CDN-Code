Goes through a .csv file

1. Open the students.csv file for reading, skip the first line of text in the file because it contains only headings, and read the other lines of the file into a dictionary. The program must store each student I-Number as a key and each I-Number name pair or each name as a value in the dictionary.
2. Get an I-Number from the user, use the I-Number to find the corresponding student name in the dictionary, and print the name.
3. If a user enters an I-Number that doesnâ€™t exist in the dictionary, your program must print the message, "No such student" (without the quotes).
