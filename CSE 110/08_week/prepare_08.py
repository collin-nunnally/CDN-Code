# Given the following list of items (copy and paste this line into your program):
colors = ["red", "blue", "green", "yellow"]

# Use a for loop to iterate through this list one by one and display each item on its own line as follows:
for color in colors:
    print(color)

print("\n")

# Use a for loop to display the numbers 1–8, one number on each line as follows:
for i in range (1, 9):
    print(i)

print("\n")

# Use a for loop to display the even numbers (hint: count by two) 2–20, one number on each line as follows:
for k in range (2, 21 ,2):
    print(k)
